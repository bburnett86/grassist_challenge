1. lawnmower.js
    - Updated lawnmower object to include methods to track where lawnmower had been. It was useful to be able to track the previous locations, as well as use that information outside of the scope of the plan.
2. planner.js
    - I used a lot of methods, so as I refactored I organized them by type. Hopefully they're as easy to navigate through as they've been as useful to reuse.
3. Overall
    - This was a lot of fun, overall this is the most creative code challenge I've had in a while. Although my wheelhouse is Ruby it was really fun to be able to use my JavaScript knowledge to execute this recursive function. Either way, I hope you guys, like me, and if you do, please contact me at (312)388-1022.
